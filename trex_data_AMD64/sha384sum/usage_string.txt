Usage: %s [OPTION]... [FILE]...
Print or check %s (%d-bit) checksums.


  -b, --binary         read in binary mode

  -c, --check          read %s sums from the FILEs and check them

      --tag            create a BSD-style checksum

  -t, --text           read in text mode (default)

  -z, --zero           end each output line with NUL, not newline,
                       and disable file name escaping


The following five options are useful only when verifying checksums:
      --ignore-missing  don't fail or report status for missing files
      --quiet          don't print OK for each successfully verified file
      --status         don't output anything, status code shows success
      --strict         exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines
  -w, --warn           warn about improperly formatted checksum lines


      --help     display this help and exit

      --version  output version information and exit


The sums are computed as described in %s.  When checking, the input
should be a former output of this program.  The default mode is to print a
line with checksum, a space, a character indicating input mode ('*' for binary,
' ' for text or where binary is insignificant), and name for each FILE.

Note: There is no difference between binary mode and text mode on GNU systems.

Try '%s --help' for more information.
