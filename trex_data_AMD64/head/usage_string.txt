Usage: %s [OPTION]... [FILE]...

Print the first %d lines of each FILE to standard output.
With more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving the file name.

                             with the leading '-', print all but the last
                             NUM bytes of each file
  -n, --lines=[-]NUM       print the first NUM lines instead of the first %d;
                             with the leading '-', print all but the last
                             NUM lines of each file

  -q, --quiet, --silent    never print headers giving file names
  -v, --verbose            always print headers giving file names

  -z, --zero-terminated    line delimiter is NUL, not newline

      --help     display this help and exit

      --version  output version information and exit


NUM may have a multiplier suffix:
b 512, kB 1000, K 1024, MB 1000*1000, M 1024*1024,
GB 1000*1000*1000, G 1024*1024*1024, and so on for T, P, E, Z, Y.
Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.
