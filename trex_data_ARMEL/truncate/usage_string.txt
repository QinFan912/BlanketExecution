Usage: %s OPTION... FILE...

Shrink or extend the size of each FILE to the specified size

A FILE argument that does not exist is created.

If a FILE is larger than the specified size, the extra data is lost.
If a FILE is shorter, it is extended and the sparse extended part (hole)
reads as zero bytes.

  -c, --no-create        do not create any files

  -o, --io-blocks        treat SIZE as number of IO blocks instead of bytes

  -r, --reference=RFILE  base size on RFILE
  -s, --size=SIZE        set or adjust the file size by SIZE bytes

      --help     display this help and exit

      --version  output version information and exit


SIZE may also be prefixed by one of the following modifying characters:
'+' extend by, '-' reduce by, '<' at most, '>' at least,
'/' round down to multiple of, '%' round up to multiple of.

Try '%s --help' for more information.
