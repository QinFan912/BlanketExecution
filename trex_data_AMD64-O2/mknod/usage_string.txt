Usage: %s [OPTION]... NAME TYPE [MAJOR MINOR]

Create the special file NAME of the given TYPE.


Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

  -m, --mode=MODE    set file permission bits to MODE, not a=rw - umask

  -Z                   set the SELinux security context to default type
      --context[=CTX]  like -Z, or if CTX is specified then set the SELinux
                         or SMACK security context to CTX

      --help     display this help and exit

      --version  output version information and exit


Both MAJOR and MINOR must be specified when TYPE is b, c, or u, and they
must be omitted when TYPE is p.  If MAJOR or MINOR begins with 0x or 0X,
it is interpreted as hexadecimal; otherwise, if it begins with 0, as octal;
otherwise, as decimal.  TYPE may be:


  b      create a block (buffered) special file
  c, u   create a character (unbuffered) special file
  p      create a FIFO


NOTE: your shell may have its own version of %s, which usually supersedes
the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation
for details about the options it supports.
