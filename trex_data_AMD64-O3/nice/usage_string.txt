Usage: %s [OPTION] [COMMAND [ARG]...]

Run COMMAND with an adjusted niceness, which affects process scheduling.
With no COMMAND, print the current niceness.  Niceness values range from
%d (most favorable to the process) to %d (least favorable to the process).


Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

  -n, --adjustment=N   add integer N to the niceness (default 10)

      --help     display this help and exit

      --version  output version information and exit


NOTE: your shell may have its own version of %s, which usually supersedes
the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation
for details about the options it supports.
